# Blood-Arena
A game that I have been developing for a few months now and hopefully for a long time to come. Think Dwarf Fortress level of dedication but it's a different game, this one is about orcs and it centers around tournaments.
For now, I will be using libtcod for the rendering aspect and window handling because I don't really want to deal with that for now. Eventually I will write my own ascii renderer.
